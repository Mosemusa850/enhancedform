# HTML5 Showcase Page

This project demonstrates the use of HTML5 features including lists, tables, and media elements.  
It also includes a fully structured HTML5 form with labels, fieldsets, and native validation attributes.  
The page emphasizes semantic tags for clarity and accessibility.  
No JavaScript is usedâ€”validation relies on HTML5 capabilities.
